DESCRIPTION
-----------

This repository is a collection of cogs written for [Twentysix's](https://github.com/Twentysix26) [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot).  

> Red is a fully modular bot â€“ meaning all features and commands can be enabled/disabled to your liking, making it completely customizable.

Most of my cogs have no real value and are just for fun.
